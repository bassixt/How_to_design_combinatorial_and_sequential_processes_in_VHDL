## How to design combinatorial and sequential processes in VHDL

## Differences between combinatorial and sequential logic circuits:


* In general there are two kind of logic circuits:
 * Combinatorial circuits in which the outputs depend only on the input values through a boolean function
   ![combinatorial](images/comb.png =24*48)
 * Sequential circuits in wich the outputs depend on the input values and the story of the circuit.
   ![sequential](images/seq.png =24*48){:height="24px" width="48px"}
In the images are shown... (to add images that shows sequential circuits vs combinatorial)
