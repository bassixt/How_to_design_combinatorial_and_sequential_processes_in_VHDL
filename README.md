## How to design combinatorial and sequential processes in VHDL

## Differences between combinatorial and sequential logic circuits:


* In general there are two kind of logic circuits:
 * >Combinatorial circuits in which the outputs depend only on the input values through a boolean function. In other words a combinatorial circuit is such that it has not inferred memory elements.
   ![combinatorial](images/comb.png)
 * >Sequential circuits in wich the outputs depend on the input values and the story of the circuit.

In the images are shown... (to add images that shows sequential circuits vs combinatorial)
